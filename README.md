# myRetail Target Case Study

This application was created for the Target Engineer interview. It uses React, Redux, Firebase and Webpack.

I used an existing boilerplate that I have been working on in my spare time. Some of this may be overkill, but I wanted to show some of the tools that I use in personal projects.

The case study is published on Firebase hosting here:
